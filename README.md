# Churn-prediction

This notebook presents the work for the churn prediction using TELCO dataset.

This work is structured following the CRISP-DM method : 
1. Business understanding.
2. Data understanding:
    - Loading the Data.
    - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
3. Data preparation.
    - Dopping uncessary features.
    - Filling the missing values.
    - Encoding categorical variables.
    - Feature scaling.
3. Modeling.
    - Model selection
    - Hyperparameters tuning with random seach method.
    - Training the selected model.
    - Computing feature importance.
    - Computing the confusion matrix and the AUC on the training set.
4. Evaluation.
    - Compute predictions on the test set.
